1. Data from source
2.EDA
3.Feature Engineering
4.Model Training
5.Model Deployment


In a nutshell, these are also called components

1.Data Cleaning ..Input raw data , output : cleaned data
2.Data Ingestion ... input: cleaned data..we do train test split.. output..train and test data     
3.Data Transformation ... Feature engineering..output: train and test data
4.Model Training...Input: Train and Test data. We will create pickle file
5.Model Evaluation
6.Model Deployment


Enitre Process is for Training the Model. We can say training pipeline. starting from step 1 and ends at step 6


Prediction pipeline:
